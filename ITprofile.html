<h2> Interest in IT </h2>

<h3> <u>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</u> </h3>
<p>I found IT to be very interesting since I was 15. I say this because today, the majority of the people in the world are connected to one another through the internet and the level of programming/coding that had been undertaken over the course of the years since technology started to develop still amazes me. A lot of people don’t know this, but my interest started when I played Watchdogs 2. At the time of playing, I was thinking about how the abilities in the game could one day be done in society as things are starting to become more powered by technology making it possible for potential hacking.</p>

<h3> <u>Outline your IT experience</u> </h3>
<p> I do not have any IT experience besides knowing how my laptop works. </p>

<h3> <u>Why did you choose RMIT?</u> </h3>
<p> I chose to study Information Technology at RMIT because I believed their university had more of an advantage in job employment and practical work than any other university/institution.</p>

<h3> <u>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</u> </h3>
<p>I expect to know the general concepts of computing. This doesn’t include the basics of computing that can be self-learnt in 5 minutes. Content such as computing ethics, security, artificial intelligence, and programming are examples of what I wish to study while undertaking this degree. I also expect to develop my critical thinking as well as my problem-solving skills.</p>

<h3> <u>Position</u> </h3>
<p> The position is to be a software developer. Software developers are IT professionals who use programming languages to create software applications. This job appeals to me because coding is interesting, and I like working through problems. Along with this interest, the pay is very lucrative ranging from $100,000-120,000 a year. Their jobs include:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Upgrading, debugging, and troubleshooting current software</li>
   <li>Write clear, effective codes in accordance with the standards</li>
   <li>Collaborate with both management and technical support partners clearly and frequently.</li>
   <li>Adapting existing software to suit the target audience’s evolving demands.</li>
</ul>

<h3> <u>Skills, Qualifications, and experiences required</u> </h3>
<p>To be accepted into this position, a tertiary qualification in computer science or any other relevant qualification is required as well as relevant industry experience. Furthermore, programming experience in C# as well as WinForms. In addition to these skills, understanding the exploration and/or mining domains is considered highly desirable for the job.</p>

<h3> <u>Current Skills, Qualifications, and experiences + Plan</u> </h3>
<p>I am currently unqualified for this position as I have no experience or skills in IT that will make me hireable for the position.</p>

<p>My plan is to first complete this degree (Information Technology). During the final year of my studies, I aim to find an internship to have some practical experience before graduating. After graduating, I will find an entry-level IT job whilst completing some studying some additional IT certifications that give me the opportunity to learn new programming languages that will ensure I can become a software developer 2 years after having an entry-level job.</p>

<h3> <u>What do the results of the tests mean for you?</u> </h3>
<p>The results of the test reflect who I am as an individual and how I am viewed by others. According to the tests completed, I am an auditory learner who makes decisions based on logic rather than emotions and am more of an introvert meaning I have the tendency to be shy and nervous therefore making me comfortable talking to those with whom I already have a connection with. It also states that I have a tendency to constantly improve and adapt.  The tests conducted gave me a short reflection of whom I want to become rather than who I am as I always desire to improve constantly in life. In other words, despite the results listing who I am, I see the potential that I could have in my personality that has not been listed.</p>

<h3> <u>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</u> </h3>
<p>I don’t think the findings from the test will have any form of negative influence on my behaviour in a team. It gives me the opportunity to prevent it and understand what behaviour is best for my team. Working with a team will force me to get out of my introverted state which will give me the opportunity to change my usual state of being an introvert to an extrovert. I may have some positive influence on my behaviour in a team because I learn best by listening and every day, I seek to learn from others so it will make learning from others easy. However, a potential negative influence should I choose not to change my behaviour in a team, maybe the decision-making for the team which I make logically rather than emotionally for other people.</p>

<h3> <u>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</u> </h3>
<p>I should look over my test results before forming a team with others. This way I can evaluate what type of person I am and how I want to be viewed by the team. I should carry my listening skills to the team as well as the constant seeking for improvement but I should not carry the state of being introverted throughout the whole period of being with the team. The team will also require deadlines, so I need to learn to finish work before the deadline so as not to create stress for myself and the team. Overall, I need to ensure that I can keep up my listening skills, talk more and desensitise myself from stress through talking to other people for advice or help.</p>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>

<h3> <u>Overview</u> </h3>
<p>This project is called SportsScout. This project is made for the youth aged between (13-18) across different sports such as Soccer, Basketball, Netball, and Australian football to have an opportunity to be discovered by scouts from major sports organisations from Australia and other countries around the world. Not only does SportsScout provide offers for the players, it also provides confidential messaging between a scout and a player to have a special training session in front of the organisation.</p>

<h3> <u>Motivation</u> </h3>
<p>This project is interesting because it gives student-athletes/athletes an opportunity to make their dreams come true of playing for major sports leagues by working hard and trying to be the best version of themselves. Growing up, I played a high division of Basketball and I wanted to know where I was ranked in Victoria so that I could push myself to be the number 1 in the state, and more importantly, push myself to be the best player that I could be. This project reflects Australian teens being ranked 140th out of 146 countries studied in terms of high physical activity via the World Health Organisation.</p>

<h3> <u>Description</u> </h3>
<p>The idea of this project is to take rankings of the youth playing sports in Australia seriously so that they can follow their dreams.</p>

<p>If an individual is a player of any sport, the login details will be provided by the sports club they join. It will feature a Player profile that is generally where the personal information (Name, Class, D.O.B, Email, Sport etc) will be shown which eases the search for the scout looking into the player. It will also contain an offers button within the player profile showcasing the offers placed on the player by a sports organisation or college willing to take the player. The Player profile will have the player's rank from their respective sport against the rest of the state to show the scout where the player is ranked. Finally, the player profile will have a videos section to boost their chances of getting an offer. The videos section of the player profile will only be used for players aged 15-18. Along with the player profile, it will also have the ‘mySTATS’ option which gives the scout an inspection of the player's numbers whilst playing for a team.</p>

<p>If an individual is a certified scout, the login details will be provided by the company they are working for. Their login will feature a scout profile listing where they’re from, what company they work for and their interest in players. The scouts will have the option to ‘star’ a player profile meaning they are interested in the player. Players who get interested by a scout will have a notification stating ‘(Name of Scout, sports organisation) has an interest in your talent!’. They will also have a verification tick next to their profile showing they have been certified in the app.</p>

<p>Both Scouts and Players have a given ‘inbox’ button where they can talk amongst each other. Players aren’t given access to talk to scouts first and instead it is the scouts that initiate the conversation between players first. Players will then have the option to send a message once a message has been sent by the scout first. To initiate a conversation with a player, the scout must first click the ‘star’ option on a player profile which will then give a ‘Send Message’ option after.</p>

<h3> <u>Tools and technologies</u> </h3>
<p>Hardware for this service to be accessible can be from smartphones and computers. The software component is the heart of the service needed to be made as it consists of mainly an application programming language and design tool. Using a programming language will give certain instructions for computers to follow.</p>

<h3> <u>Skills Required</u> </h3>
<ul>
   <li>Data Skills</li>
   <li>Programming skills (written in JavaScript)</li>
   <li>Attention to detail</li>
   <li>Coding skills</li>
   <li>IT security skills</li>
</ul>

<h3> <u>Outcome</u> </h3>
<p>If the project is successful:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Login will be easy for both scouts and players</li>
   <li>The player’s stats will be updated regularly</li>
   <li>Scouts will be able to show interest by pressing the ‘star’ option</li>
   <li>The rankings of players are updated regularly</li>
   <li>The upload video option becomes accessible when a player is aged between 15-18</li>
</ul>

<p>Although this project will not have an impact on the world, it will certainly have an impact on the sports media. It makes viewing new talent of players easier to be able to scout in Australia and promotes physical activity as well as healthy competition.</p>
